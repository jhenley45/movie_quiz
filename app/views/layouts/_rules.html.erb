		<h1>The Rules</h1>
			<div class="rules_content">
			<p>1.) Begin each round by entering the title of a movie.</p>
			<p>2.) You will then be prompted to enter an actor or actress in that movie. If you are correct, you will advance. Incorrect, and your round will end.</p>
			<p>3.) Next you will be prompted to enter a movie that your actor/actress was in. If correct, this process repeats itself.</p>
			<p>4.) You do not need to capitalize answers, but misspellings will cause you to lose.</p>
			<p>5.) If you repeat an answer during your round (e.g. use "Matt Damon" for two different movies) you will lose.</p>
			<p>6.) Points are awarded for correct responses.</p>
			<p>7.) For every 5 correct answers you will move up one level. Points are multiplied each level.</p>
			<p>8.) For each level you go up, the time you have to respond will decrease.</p>
